# Rough Draft

## Research question: Whatâ€™s the growth of Eastern North Carolina compared to the rest of the state?


North Carolina is considered to be one of the fastest growing states, but is growth equally distributed? We would like to answer the following questions:

* Which areas are falling behind compared to rest of state?
* Is each region in ENC growing equally
* what ethnic groups are moving in versus out?
* Whatâ€™s does income levels look like per ethnic group?
* Is each NC area being invested into equally?
* what industries are thriving (need to define thriving) which are not?
* How many people are renting versus buying?
* Which groups are renting versus buying?
* Are we performing well compared to other NC areas, if well, does this come at a
cost?

Population tables:
* have a population table for each state
* split population into date tables
* have a population table where it has population for each county in North Carolina
for 2019 and 2015
* separate into respective ethnic groups
* counties in inner banks (ENC)
* counites in outer banks (ENC)
* counties in southeast (ENC)
* counties in sandhills (ENC)
* counties in triangle (MIDDLE)
* counties in piedmont triad (MIDDLE)
* counties in metrolina (MIDDLE)
* counties in mountains (WESTERN)

Economic tables:
* total expenditure per county
* total investment per county and split into separate industries
* gross earnings per county and broken down into ethnic groups
* total renting per county broken down into ethnic groups 
* total house buying per county broken down into ethnic groups
